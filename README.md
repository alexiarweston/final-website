## peer feedback

> reorganize css files
> fixed! css have their own folder, also created files for each page and split the css down so it is easier to find things.

> drop-down section of nav
> removed this from mobile view as a hover effect wouldn't make sense and there is less room. also added a transparent background so hopefully it is easier to read the options. I know that external links isn't typical in  navbar is not typical, but I wanted to showcase the type of coding to create a two tier navbar and I don't have enough pages to do it within my own site. hopefully it makes sense!

> not working at < 400px
> added more media queries for this fix.

> readability issues with some of the headers
> fixed! make a lighter shadow so the font is less blurry.

>navbar highlighting what page youre on
>changed the navbar so the page you are on is still on the bar but it is highlighted for clarity.

## changes made

- **navbar**
  - each page stays on the navbar but is highlighted
  - drop-down has transparent background to add some contrast so it is more visible when you hover

- **main page**
  - added cat gallery!! SO PROUD. it scrolls on its own and has pretty gradients on the sides.

- **above and beyond page**
  - new page added. lots of videos and content. it is set up in 3 columns

- **tnr page**
  - fixed title so that the trap neuter return part is on a second line.
 
- **all pages**
  - changed footer so it is not a box but a gradient like at the top of the page.
  - "return to top" added to footer so it is more balanced between the main content and the footer content

## PREVIOUS CHANGES

## peer feedback

> It was noted that I should move the navigation bar to be above the banner at the top of the website. 

> I did make this adjustment and moved the navigation bar to be at the top of the page for the secondary pages. I kept it in the same spot on the main page to distinguish it from the other pages, as it should be unique. It was also noted that the navigation was hard to read with the background image. As cute as it was, I removed it and did a lot of tinkering to create a navbar that is aesthetically pleasing as well as operable.

## changes made

- **navbar**
  - navigation bar is now cleaner without the background image.
  - the navbar is still horizontal, the second tier drops down cleanly, there is a hover effect when each of the links are highlighted
  - made the text at the top of the pages in the blurb section tighter so it didn't run across the full page

- **main page**
  - added picture with captions, these are images from when I worked at the local animal shelter
  - Used new fonts throughout, new fonts for the title, cat themed. the h2 tag also has a new font and there is a page break line with cat illustrations that I found from a third font.
  - added more introdution text, set up in a grid with the images for a dynamic look
  - changed the background color to a gradient at the top since I removed the background image
  - also added a favicon with a little pawprint

- **care page**
  - Added a supply list with a icon as the new bullet point, this is the same icon as the favicon, there is credit at the bottom of the list
  - added pictures from my time at the shelter here as well. also added text to fill out the space more

- **kitten stages**
  - added multiple youtube videos and adjusted them so they sat well within the grid container
  - text has been corrected to fit the kitten stages

- **tnr page**
  - changed to a 3-column grid so that it was different from the other pages
