## peer feedback

> It was noted that I should move the navigation bar to be above the banner at the top of the website. 

> I did make this adjustment and moved the navigation bar to be at the top of the page for the secondary pages. I kept it in the same spot on the main page to distinguish it from the other pages, as it should be unique. It was also noted that the navigation was hard to read with the background image. As cute as it was, I removed it and did a lot of tinkering to create a navbar that is aesthetically pleasing as well as operable.

## changes made

- **navbar**
  - navigation bar is now cleaner without the background image.
  - the navbar is still horizontal, the second tier drops down cleanly, there is a hover effect when each of the links are highlighted
  - made the text at the top of the pages in the blurb section tighter so it didn't run across the full page

- **main page**
  - added picture with captions, these are images from when I worked at the local animal shelter
  - Used new fonts throughout, new fonts for the title, cat themed. the h2 tag also has a new font and there is a page break line with cat illustrations that I found from a third font.
  - added more introdution text, set up in a grid with the images for a dynamic look
  - changed the background color to a gradient at the top since I removed the background image
  - also added a favicon with a little pawprint

- **care page**
  - Added a supply list with a icon as the new bullet point, this is the same icon as the favicon, there is credit at the bottom of the list
  - added pictures from my time at the shelter here as well. also added text to fill out the space more

- **kitten stages**
  - added multiple youtube videos and adjusted them so they sat well within the grid container
  - text has been corrected to fit the kitten stages

- **tnr page**
  - changed to a 3-column grid so that it was different from the other pages
