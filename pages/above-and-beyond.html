            <p>
                There are many ways to go above and beyond basic cat care. This guide explores harness training
                techniques,

            <h2>Clicker Training</h2>
            <p>
                Clicker training is a positive reinforcement method that can be used to teach your cat various tricks
                and behaviors.
                It involves using a clicker to mark desired behaviors, followed by a treat. This method can help
                strengthen the bond between you and your cat while providing mental stimulation. 'Sit', is a great first
                trick to teach your cat, and it can be done in just a few minutes a day.

            <h2>Harness Training</h2>
            <p>
                Training your cat to walk on a leash can provide them with safe outdoor exploration. Start by getting
                your
                cat used to wearing a harness indoors, then gradually introduce the leash. Always supervise your cat
                while
                they are outside to ensure their safety. They'll become your little adventure buddy, and you'll both
                enjoy the fresh air and exercise.
            </p>

            <h2>DIY Enrichment</h2>
            <p>
                If you're a crafty person, you can create your own cat toys and enrichment activities. Simple items like
                cardboard boxes, paper bags, and feather wands can provide hours of entertainment. You can also make
                puzzle feeders to stimulate your cat's mind and encourage natural hunting behaviors.

            <h2>Cat TV</h2>
            <p>
                Setting up a bird feeder or squirrel feeder outside a window can provide your cat with endless
                entertainment. Cats love watching birds and other wildlife, and this can keep them mentally stimulated.
                You can also find videos specifically designed for cats that feature birds, fish, or other animals to
                watch.

            <h2>Catios</h2>
            <p>
                A catio is an enclosed outdoor space that allows your cat to enjoy the outdoors safely. It can be as
                simple as a window box or as elaborate as a full backyard enclosure. Catios provide a safe environment
                for your cat to explore, play, and relax while protecting them from predators and traffic.

            <h2>Catwalks</h2>
            <p>
                Catwalks are elevated platforms that allow your cat to explore vertical spaces in your home. They can be
                installed along walls or in corners, providing your cat with a unique perspective and exercise
                opportunities. Catwalks can also help reduce stress by giving your cat a place to retreat to when they
                need some alone time.
