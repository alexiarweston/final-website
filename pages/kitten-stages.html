            <h3>Neonate Stage (0-2 weeks)</h3>
            <p>

            <h3>Transitional Stage (2-4 weeks)</h3>
            <p>

                pace at this age, requiring close monitoring and delicate care. At 4 weeks, they are starting to explore
                their environment and learn to move on to solid food.

                they start to play with their littermates, which is crucial for their social development. They should be
                showing interest in solid foods.
