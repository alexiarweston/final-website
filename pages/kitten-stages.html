            <h2>Neonate Stage (0-2 weeks)</h2>
            <p>
                Kittens are born blind and deaf, relying on their mother for warmth and nourishment. They begin to open
                their eyes and ears around two weeks old.

            <h2>Transitional Stage (2-4 weeks)</h2>
            <p>
                These kittens still require their mother, without them, they need bottle-feeding. They grow at a rapid pace at this age, requiring close monitoring and delicate care. At 4 weeks, they are starting to explore their environment and learn to move on to solid food.

            <h2>Socialization Stage (3-7 weeks)</h2>
            <p>
                This is a pivotal time for kittens to learn social skills. They should be handled gently by humans and exposed to various stimuli to help them become well-adjusted adults. Their senses are developing, and they start to play with their littermates, which is crucial for their social development. They should be showing interest in solid foods.
